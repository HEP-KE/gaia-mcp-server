"""Optional HPC dispatch: run this server's compute kernels on DOE facilities.

Local execution is the default and is untouched by this module. Calling
set_dispatch("polaris"|"perlmutter") routes the compute-heavy tools through
the hep-genesis dispatch engine instead: the tools/ package is staged to the
facility, the kernel runs on a compute node via IRI, and results (plus any
files the kernel wrote) come back to this machine.

Requirements on the machine RUNNING THIS SERVER (only for remote sites):
- the hep-genesis backend importable in this environment
  (pip install -e <hep-genesis-agent>/backend[iri])
- facility sign-in (hep-genesis-alcf-auth / -transfer-auth CLIs, or the
  desktop app's HPC panel) — check with the auth_status tool
- Globus Connect Personal running (staging + fetch-back use it)

State is process-local and read at call time, so an agent can flip sites
per message. Nothing here imports hep_genesis until a remote site is chosen.
